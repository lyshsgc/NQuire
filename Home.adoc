These pages are the application documentation of the NQuire.

These pages are written in asciidoc format (see ...)
html or pdf code is generated from that.

== Targets

This documentation *should* be minimal but complete (but it is not complete):

 - self-explanatory code is preferred
 - function headers and file headers are preferred when that documentation does not surpass the scope of that file.
 - everything else worth noting is or should be described here.
